# HYBRID-DEEPFAKE-VIDEO-DETECTION-USING-XCEPTION-and-LSTM
A hybrid deep learning model combining Xception (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence analysis to detect deepfake videos. The system improves accuracy by analyzing both frame-level and sequence-level inconsistencies in video data.
